# Progress: Tab Manager by Schedise

**Date:** [Insert Current Date]

**1. What Works:** - Initial Memory Bank structure created (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`). - Core website structure (React, Vite, Tailwind, TS) is in place. - Key marketing pages (`Index`, `Premium`, `About`, `GettingStarted`) have been updated with Tab Manager content, replacing the previous Ad Blocker focus. - Routing between these pages is functional. - UI components (Navbar, Footer, Banner, BentoGrid, etc.) are functional.

**2. What's Left to Build / Update:** - **Content Updates:** - `Features.tsx`: Needs full content rewrite for Tab Manager features. - `Support.tsx`: FAQs need to be updated for Tab Manager. - `Privacy.tsx`: Needs review and update for Tab Manager context. - `Terms.tsx`: Needs review and update for Tab Manager context. - `Whitelisting.tsx`: Needs renaming and content update (or deletion). - `README.md`: Needs update. - `index.html`: Metadata and favicon links need updating. - **Branding:** - Replace logo image/component (likely in `Navbar.tsx`). - Add new favicon files to `/public` and link in `index.html`. - **Functionality (Extension - High Level):** - Core tab grouping logic. - Tab search implementation. - Saving/loading groups from `chrome.storage`. - Popup UI development. - Background script logic. - Premium feature implementation (sync, themes, etc.). - Packaging for Chrome Web Store. - **Functionality (Website - Potential):** - User accounts/authentication (if needed for premium sync). - Payment integration (if premium is paid).

**3. Current Status:** - **Phase:** Content and Branding Transition. - **Description:** Currently focused on replacing all remnants of the "Ad Blocker" product with the new "Tab Manager" identity across the marketing website. Memory Bank is being established. Core extension functionality is not yet implemented.

**4. Known Issues:** - Placeholder image on the landing page (`Index.tsx`) needs replacement with a relevant Tab Manager UI screenshot/graphic. - Icons used in feature sections (`lucide-react`) need to be double-checked for relevance to the described Tab Manager features across all updated pages. - The file `src/pages/knowledge/Whitelisting.tsx` still exists with ad blocker content and needs attention. - Logo and Favicon are still the old ones. - `README.md` still describes an Ad Blocker. - `index.html` metadata is outdated. - `Support.tsx` FAQs are outdated. - `Privacy.tsx` and `Terms.tsx` content relate to Ad Blocker. - `Features.tsx` content relates to Ad Blocker.
