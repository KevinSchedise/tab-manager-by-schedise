# Product Context: Tab Manager by Schedise

**Date:** [Insert Current Date]

**1. Why This Project Exists:** - **Problem:** Modern web browsing often leads to an overwhelming number of open tabs ("tab overload"). This disorganization hinders productivity, makes finding specific information difficult, consumes system resources, and can cause cognitive fatigue. - **Goal:** To provide a user-friendly and efficient solution for managing browser tabs, reducing clutter, and improving the overall browsing experience.

**2. Problems It Solves:** - **Tab Clutter:** Reduces the visual noise and cognitive load associated with having too many tabs open. - **Lost Tabs:** Helps users quickly find specific tabs they need, preventing time wasted searching. - **Workflow Inefficiency:** Enables users to group related tabs for specific tasks or projects, improving focus and workflow. - **Resource Consumption:** While not its primary goal, managing and potentially suspending inactive tabs (future feature?) could help reduce browser memory/CPU usage. - **Cross-Device Discontinuity (Premium):** Addresses the challenge of maintaining tab organization across multiple computers.

**3. How It Should Work (Core Concepts):** - **Chrome Extension:** The primary product is a Chrome browser extension. - **Tab Grouping:** Users can create, name, color-code, and manage groups of related tabs. - **Tab Search:** Users can search across the titles and potentially URLs of all open tabs. - **Persistence:** Tab groups should ideally persist across browser sessions. - **Intuitive UI:** The extension popup and any options pages should be easy to understand and use. - **Free Core Features:** Essential tab grouping and searching should be available for free. - **Premium Enhancements:** Offer advanced features like cross-device sync, custom themes/layouts, and potentially more powerful search or automation for a subscription fee. - **Marketing Website:** A dedicated website (this codebase) to explain features, benefits, pricing, and provide support.

**4. User Experience Goals:** - **Effortless Organization:** Make tab management feel seamless and intuitive, not like another chore. - **Increased Productivity:** Help users find information faster and switch between contexts more efficiently. - **Reduced Stress:** Alleviate the feeling of being overwhelmed by too many tabs. - **Visually Appealing:** Provide a clean, modern, and customizable interface (especially with themes). - **Reliable:** Ensure tab groups and settings are saved reliably (locally for free users, synced for premium). - **Lightweight:** The extension should not significantly impact browser performance.

**5. Target Audience:** - Students, researchers, developers, writers, project managers, and anyone who frequently works with numerous browser tabs. - Users looking to improve their productivity and digital organization. - Individuals frustrated with the limitations of native browser tab management.
